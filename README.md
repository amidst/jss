# AMIDST: a Java Toolbox for Scalable Probabilistic Machine Learning

This folder contains the code examples shown in the paper using the AMIDST Toolbox. This includes all the required material for running the code (unix script files, jar libraries, java files, etc.). In particular:

- src: contains the source code (i.e., .java files) of each examples. There
 is a file for each section.
- lib: the required libraries (AMIDST Toolbox and third-party software).
- datasets: the data used in the examples.
- bin: empty folder used when compiling the code examples.


There is one code-example for each subsection in section 3. For running compiling an running each code example, run the scripts in this folder. For example, for the examples from section 3.1, run:

	$ ./run31.sh

These scripts can only be executed in a UNIX system. The AMIDST Toolbox requires JAVA 1.8 or higher.
